# **SECTION C — CHEMISTRY; METALLURGY**
> ### <u>**Note**</u>
> 1. In section C, the definitions of groups of chemical elements are as follows:
> 		- <u>Alkali metals:</u> Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr
> 		- <u>Alkaline earth metals:</u> Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra
> 		- <u>Lanthanides:</u> elements with atomic numbers 57 to 71 inclusive
> 		- <u>Rare earths:</u> Sc, Y, Lanthanides
> 		- <u>Actinides:</u> elements with atomic numbers 89 to 103 inclusive
> 		- <u>Refractory metals:</u> Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W
> 		- <u>Halogens:</u> F, Cl, Br, I, At
> 		- <u>Noble gases:</u> He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn
> 		- <u>Platinum group:</u> Os, Ir, Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd
> 		- <u>Noble metals:</u> Ag, Au, Platinum group
> 		- <u>Light metals:</u> alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Be, Al, Mg
> 		- <u>Heavy metals:</u> metals other than light metals
> 		- <u>Iron group:</u> Fe, Co, Ni
> 		- <u>Non-metals:</u> H, B, C, Si, N, P, O, S, Se, Te, noble gases, halogens
> 		- <u>Metals:</u> elements other than non-metals
> 		- <u>Transition elements:</u> elements with atomic numbers 21 to 30 inclusive, 39 to 48 inclusive, 57 to 80 inclusive, 89 upwards
> 2. Section C <u>covers</u>:
> 		- pure chemistry, which covers inorganic compounds, organic compounds, macromolecular compounds, and their methods of preparation;
> 		- applied chemistry, which covers compositions containing the above compounds, such as: glass, ceramics, fertilisers, plastics compositions, paints, products of the petroleum industry. It also <u>covers</u> certain compositions on account of their having particular properties rendering them suitable for certain purposes, as in the case of explosives, dyestuffs, adhesives, lubricants, and detergents;
> 		- certain marginal industries, such as the manufacture of coke and of solid or gaseous fuels, the production and refining of oils, fats and waxes, the fermentation industry (e.g., brewing and wine-making), the sugar industry;
> 		- certain operations or treatments, which are either purely mechanical, e.g., the mechanical treatment of leather and skins, or partly mechanical, e.g., the treatment of water or the prevention of corrosion in general;
> 		- metallurgy, ferrous or non-ferrous alloys.
> 3. 
> 		- In the case of operations, treatments, products or articles having both a chemical and a non-chemical part or aspect, the general rule is that the chemical part or aspect is covered by section C.
> 		- In some of these cases, the chemical part or aspect brings with it a non-chemical one, even though purely mechanical, because this latter aspect either is essential to the operation or treatment or constitutes an important element thereof. It has seemed, in fact, more logical not to dissociate the different parts or aspects of a coherent whole. This is the case for applied chemistry and for the industries, operations and treatments mentioned in Notes (1)(c), (d) and (e). For example, furnaces peculiar to the manufacture of glass are covered by class C03 and not by class F27.
> 		- There are, however, some exceptions in which the mechanical (or non-chemical) aspect carries with it the chemical aspect, for example:
> 			- Certain extractive processes, in subclass A61K;
> 			- The chemical purification of air, in subclass A61L;
> 			- Chemical methods of fire-fighting, in subclass A62D;
> 			- Chemical processes and apparatus, in class B01;
> 			- Impregnation of wood, in subclass B27K;
> 			- Chemical methods of analysis or testing, in subclass G01N;
> 			- Photographic materials and processes, in class G03, and, generally, the chemical treatment of textiles and the production of cellulose or paper, in section D.
> 		- In still other cases, the pure chemical aspect is covered by section C and the applied chemical aspect by another section, such as A, B or F, e.g., the use of a substance or composition for:
> 			- treatment of plants or animals, covered by subclass A01N;
> 			- foodstuffs, covered by class A23;
> 			- ammunition or explosives, covered by class F42.
> 		- When the chemical and mechanical aspects are so closely interlocked that a neat and simple division is not possible, or when certain mechanical processes follow as a natural or logical continuation of a chemical treatment, section C may cover, in addition to the chemical aspect, a part only of the mechanical aspect, e.g., after-treatment of artificial stone, covered by class C04. In this latter case, a note or a reference is usually given to make the position clear, even if sometimes the division is rather arbitrary.

## **C01 INORGANIC CHEMISTRY** (processing powders of inorganic compounds preparatory to the manufacturing of ceramic products C04B 35/00; fermentation or enzyme-using processes for the preparation of elements or inorganic compounds except carbon dioxide C12P 3/00; obtaining metal compounds from mixtures, e.g. ores, which are intermediate compounds in a metallurgical process for obtaining a free metal C21B, C22B; production of non-metallic elements or inorganic compounds by electrolysis or electrophoresis C25B)
> ### <u>**Note**</u>
> 1. In subclasses C01B to C01G, and within each of these subclasses, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, a compound is classified in the last appropriate place, e.g. potassium permanganate is classified only as a permanganate compound, in subclass C01G.
> 2. Biocidal, pest repellant, pest attractant or plant growth regulatory activity of compounds or preparations is further classified in subclass A01P.
> 3. Processes using enzymes or micro-organisms in order to:
> 		- liberate, separate or purify a pre-existing compound or composition, or to
> 		- treat textiles or clean solid surfaces of materialsare further classified in subclass C12S.

In subclasses C07C to C07K and within each of theses subclasses, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, and with the exception referred to below, a compound is classified in the last appropriate place. For example, 2-butyl-pyridine, which contains an acyclic chain and a heterocyclic ring, is classified only as a heterocyclic compound, in subclass C07D. In general, and in the absence of an indication to the contrary (such as groups C07C 59/00), the terms "acyclic" and "aliphatic" are used to describe compounds in which there is no ring; and, if a ring were present, the compound would be taken by the "last place" rule to a later group for cycloaliphatic or aromatic compounds, if such a group exists. Where a compound or an entire group of compounds exists in tautomeric forms, it is classified as though existing in the form which is classified last in the system, unless the other form is specifically mentioned earlier in the system.
> 4. Chemical compounds and their preparation are classified in the groups for the type of compound prepared. The processes of preparation are also classified in the groups for the types of reaction employed, if of interest. General processes for the preparation of a class of compounds falling into more than one main group are classified in the groups for the processes employed, when such groups exist. The compounds prepared are also classified in the groups for the types of compound prepared, if of interest.
> 5. In this class, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, the compounds containing carboxyl or thiocarboxyl groups are classified as the relevant carboxylic or thiocarboxylic acids, unless the "last place rule" (<u>see</u> Note (3), above) dictates otherwise; a carboxyl group being a carbon atom having three bonds, and no more than three, to hetero atoms, other than nitrogen atoms of nitro or nitroso groups, with at least one multiple bond to the same hetero atom and a thiocarboxyl group being a carboxyl group having at least one bond to a sulfur atom, e.g. amides or nitriles of carboxylic acids, are classified with the corresponding acids.
> 6. Salts of a compound, unless specifically provided for, are classified as that compound, e.g. aniline hydrochloride is classified as containing carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen only (in group C07C 211/00), sodium malonate is classified as malonic acid (in C07C 55/00), and a mercaptide is classified as the mercaptan. Metal chelates are dealt with in the same way. Similarly, metal alcoholates and metal phenates are classified in subclass C07C and not in subclass C07F, the alcoholates in group C07C 31/00 and the phenates as the corresponding phenols in group C07C 39/00. Salts, adducts or complexes formed between two or more organic compounds are classified according to all compounds forming the salts, adducts or complexes.

> 		- a compound is considered to be saturated if it does not contain carbon atoms bound to each other by multiple bonds;
> 		- a compound is considered to be unsaturated if it contains carbon atoms bound to each other by multiple bonds, which includes a six-membered aromatic ring,unless otherwise specified or implicitly derivable from the subdivision, as in group C07C 69/00.
> 8. For the classification of compounds in groups C07C 201/00 to C07C 395/00, i.e. after the functional group has been determined according to the "last place rule", a compound is classified according to the following principles:
> 		- compounds are classified in accordance with the nature of the carbon atom to which the functional group is attached;
> 		- a carbon skeleton is a carbon atom, other than a carbon atom of a carboxyl group, or a chain of carbon atoms bound to each other; a carbon skeleton is considered to be terminated by every bond to an element other than carbon or to a carbon atom of a carboxyl group;
> 		- when the molecule contains several functional groups, only functional groups linked to the same carbon skeleton as the one first determined are considered;
> 		- a carbon skeleton is considered to be saturated if it does not contain carbon atoms bound to each other by multiple bonds;
> 		- a carbon skeleton is considered to be unsaturated if it contains carbon atoms bound to each other by multiple bonds, which includes a six-membered aromatic ring.

### **C07D HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS**
> ### <u>**Note**</u>
> 1. This subclass <u>does not cover</u> compounds containing saccharide radicals (as defined in Note (3) following the title of subclass C07H), which are covered by subclass C07H.
> 2. In this subclass, in compounds containing a hetero ring covered by group C07D 295/00 and at least one other hetero ring, the hetero ring covered by group C07D 295/00 is considered as an acyclic chain containing nitrogen atoms.
> 3. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
> 		- "hetero ring" is a ring having at least one halogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, selenium, or tellurium atom as a ring member;
> 		- "bridged" means the presence of at least one fusion other than ortho, peri or spiro;
> 		- two rings are "condensed" if they share at least one ring member, i.e. "spiro" and "bridged" are considered as condensed;
> 		- "condensed ring system" is a ring system in which all rings are condensed among themselves;
> 		- "number of relevant rings" in a condensed ring system equals the number of scissions necessary to convert the ring system into one acyclic chain;
> 		- "relevant rings" in a condensed ring system, i.e. the rings which taken together describe all the links between every atom of the ring system, are chosen according to the following criteria consecutively:
> 			- lowest number of ring members;
> 			- highest number of hetero atoms as ring members;
> 			- lowest number of members shared with other rings;
> 			- last place in the classification scheme.
> 4. Attention is drawn to Note (3) after class C07, which defines the last place priority rule applied in the range of subclasses C07C to C07K and within these subclasses.
> 5. Therapeutic activity of compounds is further classified in subclass A61P.
> 6. In this subclass, in the absence of an indication to the contrary:
> 		- compounds having only one hetero ring are classified in the last appropriate place in one of the groups C07D 203/00 to C07D 347/00. The same applies for compounds having more hetero rings covered by the same main group, neither condensed among themselves nor condensed with a common carbocyclic ring system;
> 		- compounds having two or more hetero rings covered by different main groups neither condensed among themselves nor condensed with a common carbocyclic ring system are classified in the last appropriate place in one of the groups C07D 401/00 to C07D 421/00;
> 		- compounds having two or more relevant hetero rings, covered by the same or by different main groups, which are condensed among themselves or condensed with a common carbocyclic ring system, are classified in the last appropriate place in one of the groups C07D 451/00 to C07D 519/00.
> 7. In this subclass:
> 		- where a compound may exist in tautomeric forms, it is classified as though existing in the form which is classified last in the system. Therefore, double bonds between ring members and non-ring members and double bonds between ring members themselves are considered equivalent in determining the degree of hydrogenation of the ring. Formulae are considered to be written in Kekule form;
> 		- hydrocarbon radicals containing a carbocyclic ring and an acyclic chain by which it is linked to the hetero ring and being substituted on both the carbocyclic ring and the acyclic chain by hetero atoms or by carbon atoms having three bonds to hetero atoms with at the most one bond to halogen, are classified according to the substituents on the acyclic chain. For example, the compound
> 			- ![fig54.gif](fig54.gif) is classified in group C07D 233/00, and the compound ![fig55.gif](fig55.gif)
> 			- is classified in group C07D 233/00, where X —NH<sub>2</sub>, —NHCOCH<sub>3</sub>, or —COOCH<sub>3</sub>.
> 8. Individual components of heterocyclic compounds, such as essential substituents, single hetero rings and single condensed systems, which are considered to represent information of interest for search, may also be classified according to Note (6). This can, for example, be the case when it is considered of interest to enable searching of heterocyclic compounds using a combination of classification symbols. Such non-obligatory classification should be given as "additional information".

> ### <u>**Note**</u>
> 1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
> 		- "amino acids" are compounds in which at least one amino group and at least one carboxyl group are bound to the same carbon skeleton and the nitrogen atom of the amino group may form part of a ring;
> 		- "normal peptide link" is one between an alpha-amino group of an amino acid and the carboxyl group — in position 1 — of another alpha-amino acid;
> 		- "abnormal peptide link" is a link where at least one of the linked amino acids is not an alpha-amino acid or a link formed by at least one carboxyl or amino group being part of the side chain of an alpha-amino acid;
> 		- "peptides" are compounds containing at least two amino acid units, which are bound through at least one normal peptide link, including oligopeptides, polypeptides and proteins, where
> 			- "linear peptides" may comprise rings formed through S—S bridges, or through an hydroxy or a mercapto group of an hydroxy- or a mercapto-amino acid and the carboxyl group of another amino acid (e.g. peptide lactones) but do not comprise rings which are formed only through peptide links;
> 			- "cyclic peptides" are peptides comprising at least one ring formed only through peptide links; the cyclisation may occur only through normal peptide links or through abnormal peptide links, e.g. through the 4-amino group of 2,4-diamino-butanoic acid. Thus, cyclic compounds in which at least one link in the ring is a non-peptide link are considered as "linear peptides";
> 			- "depsipeptides" are compounds containing a sequence of at least two alpha-amino acids and at least one alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acid, which are bound through at least one normal peptide link and ester links, derived from the hydroxy carboxylic acids, where
> 				- "linear depsipeptides" may comprise rings formed through S—S bridges, or through an hydroxy or a mercapto group of an hydroxy-, or mercapto-amino acid and the carboxyl group of another amino- or hydroxy-acid but do not comprise rings formed only through peptide or ester links derived from hydroxy carboxylic acids, e.g. Gly-Ala-Gly—OCH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H and Gly—OCH<sub>2</sub>CO-Ala-Gly are considered as "linear depsipeptides", but HOCH<sub>2</sub>CO-Gly-Ala-Gly does not contain an ester link, and is thus a derivative of Gly-Ala-Gly which is covered by C07K 5/00;
> 				- "cyclic depsipeptides" are peptides containing at least one ring formed only through peptide or ester links — derived from hydroxy carboxylic acids —, e.g. ![fig301.gif](fig301.gif);
> 			- "hybrid peptides" are peptides produced through fusion or covalent binding of two or more heterologous peptides.
> 2. Attention is drawn to Note (3) after class C07, which defines the last place priority rule applied in the range of subclasses C07C to C07K and within these subclasses.
> 3. Therapeutic activity of compounds is further classified in subclass A61P.
> 4. When classifying in this subclass, classification is also made in group B01D 15/08 insofar as subject matter of general interest relating to chromatography is concerned.
> 5. Fragments of peptides or peptides modified by removal or addition of amino acids, by substitution of amino acids by others, or by combination of these modifications are classified as the parent peptides. However, fragments of peptides having only four or less amino acids are also classified in group C07K 5/00.
> 6. Peptides prepared by chemical processes and having an amino acid sequence derived from naturally occurring peptides are classified with the natural one.
> 7. Peptides prepared by recombinant DNA technology are not classified according to the host, but according to the original peptide expressed, e.g. HIV peptide expressed in E. coli is classified with HIV peptides.

> 		- "use of materials for coating compositions" means the use of known or new polymers or products;
> 		- "rubber" includes:
> 			- natural or conjugated diene rubbers;
> 			- rubber in general (for a specific rubber, other than a natural rubber or a conjugated diene rubber, <u>see</u> the group provided for coating compositions based on such macromolecular compounds);
> 		- "based on" is defined by means of Note (3), below;
> 		- "filling pastes" means materials used to fill up the holes or cavities of a substrate in order to smooth its surface prior to coating.
> 2. In this subclass, coating compositions, containing specific organic macromolecular substances are classified only according to the macromolecular substance, non-macromolecular substances not being taken into account.
> 		- Example: a coating composition containing polyethene and amino-propyltrimethoxysilane is classified in group C09D 123/00.
> 		- However, coating compositions containing combinations of organic non-macromolecular compounds having at least one polymerisable carbon-to-carbon unsaturated bond with prepolymers or polymers other than unsaturated polymers of groups C09D 159/00 to C09D 187/00 are classified according to the unsaturated non-macromolecular component in group C09D 4/00.
> 		- Example: a coating composition containing polyethene and styrene monomer is classified in group C09D 4/00.
> 		- Aspects relating to the physical nature of the coating compositions or to the effects produced, as defined in group C09D 5/00, if clearly and explicitly stated, are also classified in this subclass.
> 		- Coating compositions characterised by other features, e.g. additives, are classified in group C09D 7/00, unless the macromolecular constituent is specified.
> 3. In this subclass, coating compositions comprising two or more macromolecular constituents are classified according to the macromolecular constituent or constituents present in the highest proportion, i.e. the constituent on which the composition is based. If the composition is based on two or more constituents, present in equal proportions, the composition is classified according to each of these constituents.
> 		- Example: a coating composition containing 80 parts of polyethene and 20 parts of polyvinylchloride is classified in group C09D 123/00. A coating composition containing 40 parts of polyethene and 40 parts of polyvinylchloride is classified in groups C09D 123/00 and C09D 127/02.

> ### <u>**Note**</u>
> 1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
> 		- "use of materials as adhesives" means the use of known or new polymers or products;
> 		- "rubber" includes:
> 			- natural or conjugated diene rubbers;
> 			- rubber in general (for a specific rubber, other than a natural rubber or a conjugated diene rubber, <u>see</u> the group provided for adhesives based on such macromolecular compounds);
> 		- "based on" is defined by means of Note (3), below.
> 2. In this subclass, adhesives containing specific organic macromolecular substances are classified only according to the macromolecular substance, non-macromolecular substances not being taken into account.
> 		- Example: an adhesive containing polyethene and amino-propyltrimethoxysilane is classified in group C09J 123/00.
> 		- However, adhesives containing combinations of organic non-macromolecular compounds having at least one polymerisable carbon-to-carbon unsaturated bond with prepolymers or polymers other than unsaturated polymers of groups C09J 159/00 to C09J 187/00 are classified according to the unsaturated non-macromolecular component in group C09J 4/00.
> 		- Example: an adhesive containing polyethene and styrene monomer is classified in group C09J 4/00.
> 		- Aspects relating to the physical nature of the adhesives or to the effects produced, as defined in group C09J 9/00, if clearly and explicitly stated, are also classified in this subclass.
> 		- Adhesives characterised by other features, e.g. additives, are classified in group C09J 11/00, unless the macromolecular constituent is specified.
> 3. In this subclass, adhesives comprising two or more macromolecular constituents are classified according to the macromolecular constituent or constituents present in the highest proportion, i.e. the constituent on which the adhesive is based. If the adhesive is based on two or more constituents, present in equal proportions, the adhesive is classified according to each of these constituents.Example: an adhesive containing 80 parts of polyethene and 20 parts of polyvinylchloride is classified in group C09J 123/00. An adhesive containing 40 parts of polyethene and 40 parts of polyvinylchloride is classified in groups C09J 123/00 and C09J 127/00.
> 4. In groups C09J 101/00 to C09J 201/00, any macromolecular constituent of an adhesive composition which is not identified by the classification according to Note (3) after the title of subclass C09J, and the use of which is determined to be novel and non-obvious, must also be classified in a group chosen from groups C09J 101/00 to C09J 201/00.
> 5. Any macromolecular constituent of an adhesive composition which is not identified by the classification according to Note (3) or (4) after the title of subclass C09J, and which is considered to represent information of interest for search, may also be classified in a group chosen from groups C09J 101/00 to C09J 201/00. This can, for example, be the case when it is considered of interest to enable searching of adhesive compositions using a combination of classification symbols. Such non-obligatory classification should be given as "additional information".

> 		- "aliphatic" includes "cycloaliphatic".
> 2. In this subclass, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, classification is made in the last appropriate place. Thus, a compound having an aromatic ring is classified as aromatic regardless of whether the substituent(s) of interest are on the ring or on an aliphatic part of the molecule.

> 			- Attention is drawn to the fact that a mixture of essential ingredients characterised by <u>only one</u> of its components, rather than by the mixture as a whole, is <u>not</u> classified as a mixture, e.g., a lubricating composition consisting of:
> 				- a known base-material and a new additive is classified only in the "additive" part of the classification scheme;
> 				- a known base-material with both a thickener and a further additive as essential ingredients, which may be individually known or not, is classified as a mixture of thickener and additive;
> 				- a known base-material with a combination of additives as essential ingredients, which may be individually known or not, is classified in the appropriate place for the additive mixture.
> 4. Any part of a composition which is not identified by the classification according to Notes (2) or (3) above, and which itself is determined to be novel and non-obvious, must also be classified in the last appropriate place. The part can be either a single ingredient or a composition in itself.
> 5. Any part of a composition which is not identified by the classification according to Notes (2) to (4) above, and which is considered to represent information of interest for search, may also be classified in the last appropriate place. This can, for example, be the case when it is considered of interest to enable searching of compositions using a combination of classification symbols. Such non-obligatory classification should be given as "additional information".
