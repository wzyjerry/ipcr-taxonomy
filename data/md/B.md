## **SEPARATING; MIXING**
> ### <u>**Note**</u>
> The following notes are meant to assist in the use of this part of the classification scheme; they must not be read as modifying in any way the elaborations.
> 	- In this sub-section, the separation of different materials, e.g. of different matter, size, or state, is predominantly found in the following subclasses:
> 		- B01D
> 		- B03B, B03C, B03D
> 		- B04B, B04C
> 		- B07B, B07C.
> 	- The classifying characteristics of these subclasses are:
> 		- the physical state of the matter to be separated;
> 		- the principle of the process used;
> 		- particular kinds of apparatus.The first of these characteristics involves six different aspects, assembled in three groups:
> 			- liquid/liquid or liquid/gas and gas/gas;
> 			- solid/liquid or solid/gas;
> 			- solid/solid.
> 	- These subclasses are to be used according to the following general rules:
> 		- B01D is the most general class as far as separation other than solids from solids is concerned.
> 		- Apparatus for separating solids from solids are covered by B03B when the process concerned is regarded as the equivalent of "washing" in the sense of the mining art, even if such apparatus is a pneumatic one, especially pneumatic tables or jigs. Screens <u>per se</u> are not covered by this subclass but are classified in B07B, even if they are being used in a wet process. All other apparatus for the separation of solids from solids according to dry methods are classified in B07B.
> 		- If the separation takes place as a result of the detection or measurement of some feature of the material or articles to be sorted it is classified in B07C.
> 		- It should also be noted that the separation of isotopes of the same chemical element is covered by B01D 59/00, whatever process or apparatus is employed.

***
### **B32B LAYERED PRODUCTS, i.e. PRODUCTS BUILT-UP OF STRATA OF FLAT OR NON-FLAT, e.g. CELLULAR OR HONEYCOMB, FORM**
> ### <u>**Note**</u>
> 1. This subclass <u>covers</u>:
> 		- layered products comprising different kinds of material or layered products not characterised by the particular kind of material used;
> 		- a product similar to a layered product but comprising only material in the form of a sheet or network embedded in a mass of plastics or of physically-similar substances which mass penetrates the said sheet or network and lies on both sides of the latter (e.g. so that the sheet or network reinforces the plastics substance) <u>provided that</u> the embedded sheet or network extends coherently or connectedly over substantially the whole area of the product; thus the embedded sheet or network may be a fabric or a series of rods connected by cross wires. The manner of making such a product is, however, classified in this subclass only if it is essentially a process of building-up an assembly of layers of which at least one outer layer is preformed. If the embedded material comprises only a series of unconnected rods, the product is not classified in this subclass.
> 2. This subclass <u>does not cover</u>:
> 		- processes or apparatus used in, or in connection with, the production or treatment of any product, if the process or apparatus is solely applicable to and fully classifiable in a single other class or subclass for processes or apparatus, e.g. B05, B29, B44D, C08J, C09J, C23;
> 		- compositions or preparation or treatment thereof, unless they are essentially restricted to layered products and cannot be fully classified in another class without ignoring this restriction;
> 		- etched metallic pattern on the surface of a printed circuit board.
> 3. In this subclass, a film formed on a layer by spreading a substance thereon is not considered to constitute a layer itself if it serves only as an adhesive or its purpose is merely to finish a surface of a product.
> 4. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
> 		- "layer" is a sheet or strip or anything else having a small thickness relatively to its other dimensions which, together with at least one other layer, exists in a product, whether it pre-existed, e.g. as a separate sheet or strip, or was formed during the production of the layered product. It may or may not be homogeneous or cohesive; it may be an assembly of fibres or pieces of material. It may be discontinuous, e.g. in the form of a grating, honeycomb, or frame. It may or may not be in complete contact with the next layer, e.g. a corrugated layer against a flat layer;
> 		- "layered product" comprises at least two layers secured together. The term "secured" includes any method of uniting layers, e.g. needling, stitching, gluing, nailing, dovetailing or the interposition of an adhesive or adhesive impregnated support. It may also be an intermediate stage in the production of an article which is not layered in its final form, e.g. a panel with a protective layer which is stripped off when the panel is placed in its position of use. The layers are preformed layers or layers formed <u>in situ</u> on a preformed layer and may consist of coherent solid materials, including honeycombs and other cellular materials or of non-coherent solid materials composed of assemblies of strands, strips, fibres, tiles or the like;
> 		- "filamentary layer" means a layer of threads or filaments of any substance (e.g. wires) of more or less unlimited length placed in an orderly arrangement and secured together; it may be woven, knitted, braided, or netted, or formed of threads crossed or laid side and bonded together;
> 		- "fibrous layer" means a random assembly of fibres or filaments, usually of limited length, e.g. felt, fleece; the fibres may or may not be interengaged or connected, e.g. by adhesive.
> 5. In groups B32B 1/00 to B32B 33/00, at each level of indentation, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, classification is made in the <u>first</u> appropriate place.
> 6. Layered products are classified in groups B32B 37/00 or B32B 38/00 if not characterised by their structure or composition.
> 7. The classification of layered products is provided for in many classes, most of which are confined to a particular kind of material. However, in order that this subclass may provide a basis for making a complete search with respect to layered products, all relevant subject matter is classified in this subclass even though it may also be classified in other classes.

> 	- a means for preventing a vehicle from exceeding a particular speed is often referred to as a "governor", whereas a means for maintaining the vehicle within a relatively narrow speed range is generally designated as "speed control". Since these two functions are frequently interrelated, no attempt has been made to identify such means as being particularly adapted to perform only one, or the other of the functions.&nbsp;

> 1. This class <u>covers</u> micro-structural devices or systems, including at least one essential element or formation characterised by its very small size, typically within the range of 10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>-7</sup> meters, i.e. its significant features can not, in at least one dimension, be completely discerned without the use of an optical microscope.
> 2. In this class, the following expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
> 		- "micro-structural devices" covers:
> 			- micro-mechanical devices comprising movable, flexible or deformable elements; and
> 			- three-dimensional structures without movable, flexible or deformable elements, comprising microformations designed to accomplish an essential structural function for interacting with their environment, as opposed to purely electronic or chemical functions, regardless of whether the structures are combined with micro-electronic devices or formed from specific materials;
> 		- "micro-structural systems" covers:
> 			- systems of cooperating micro-structural devices; and
> 			- micro-electro-mechanical or micro-opto-mechanical systems, which combine on a common substrate the specific features of micro-structural devices and electrical or optical components, e.g. for controlling, analysing or signalling the functioning of micro-structural devices.
